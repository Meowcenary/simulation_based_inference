# Simulation Based Inference
### boot
Seems like the best option given time constraints
- [Boot package on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/boot/)
- [Boot PDF manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/boot/boot.pdf)

### Clarify
This is complicated

### gumboot
This seems significantly easier to implement
